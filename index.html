          Motörhead were an English rock band formed in London in 1975 by
          bassist and lead vocalist Lemmy Kilmister, guitarist Larry Wallis and
          drummer Lucas Fox.Lemmy was also the primary songwriter and only
          constant member. The band are often considered a precursor to the new
          wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the
          late 1970s and early 1980s.Though several guitarists and drummers have
          played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles
          feature drummer Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor and guitarist "Fast"
          Eddie Clarke.Motörhead released 23 studio albums, 10 live recordings,
          12 compilation albums and five EPs over a career spanning 40 years.
          Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s
          with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums
          Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades and, particularly, the live album No
          Sleep 'til Hammersmith cemented Motörhead's reputation as a top-tier
          rock band.The band are ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists
          of Hard Rock.As of 2016, the band has sold more than 15 million albums
          worldwide.

        <p>
          Ian Fraser Kilmister, known by his stage name Lemmy, was born on
          December 24, 1945, in Stoke-on-Trent, England. Renowned as the
          frontman of Motörhead, he stands as one of the iconic figures in the
          realm of rock and metal, leaving behind a legacy that defied musical
          boundaries. Lemmy's musical journey traces back to the late 1960s,
          making his initial mark with the psychedelic rock band Hawkwind.
          However, it was in 1975 that he took the pivotal step of forming
          Motörhead, a band that would redefine the landscape of heavy metal and
          punk with their fast-paced, high-energy sound. Lemmy's vocals, bass
          guitar skills, and lyrics played a pivotal role in shaping the unique
          identity of Motörhead. Recognizable by his iconic mustache, leather
          jackets, and Jack Daniel's whiskey, Lemmy became a symbol of
          rock'n'roll culture. His on-stage charisma and rugged demeanor
          solidified his status as a legendary figure. Motörhead's classic songs
          such as "Ace of Spades," "Overkill," and "Bomber" have left an
          indelible mark on the music industry. Lemmy's passing in 2015 marked a
          significant loss for the rock music community. However, his resilient
          spirit and music continue to be celebrated by countless fans. Lemmy
          Kilmister is remembered not only as a music icon but also as a legend
          whose lifestyle and rebellious spirit will endure through the ages.
